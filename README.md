# Decoder-Ring
Decoder Ring Project

This project creates three functions used to encode and decode messages:
- caesar.js
- polybius.js
- substitution.js

These functions work as following:

- Caesar takes in a message and shift number and shifts the letters of the message right or left based on that shift number.

- Polybius refers to the polybius square where letters are assigned a two digit numerical value and encodes/decodes based on that.

- Substitution takes in a unique 26 character alphabet as a parameter and encodes/decodes messages based on corresponding index values within the given alphabets
